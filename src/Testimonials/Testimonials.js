                    <p>"My husband and I went on a tour to China with Yao, including the Yangtze River tour.  Everything about it was a wonderful experience. He had it so well organized that at every stop people were there waiting for us; our food was delicious and ready, and our buses were on time. I would, and have, recommended this tour company. It far exceeded our expectations! You will not be disappointed."</p>

                    <p>“My daughter’s experience in China was amazing! The chance to see students in their school environment is worth hours of lectures and videos. My daughter’s love for the language and desire to learn it faster was multiplied by being able to see other kids her age interact with her. We also saw so much history and culture that literally came to life. Seeing the Terra Cotta Warriors in person was mind-blowing. We had a fantastic experience and can’t wait to take our other children who are learning Chinese.”</p>
